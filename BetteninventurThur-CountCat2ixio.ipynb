      "       IMAPS,  LDAP,  LDAPS,  POP3,  POP3S,  RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS,\r\n",
      "       SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP). The command is designed to work  without\r\n",
      "       user interaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen-\r\n",

      "       features will make your head spin!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       curl is powered by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See\r\n",
      "       libcurl(3) for details.\r\n",

      "URL\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs  by  writing  part  sets\r\n",

      "         http://site.{one,two,three}.com\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line.  They  will  be\r\n",
      "       fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       You  can  specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number\r\n",
